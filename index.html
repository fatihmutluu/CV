                                    <p>MemoryRace is a card-matching game I designed to help improve memory and thinking skills. Built using Unity, MemoryRace offers a classic card-matching experience with a twist: a unique scoring system. Players score 2 points for every correct match, but lose 1 point for every mistake. To add to the challenge, the game starts with a 60-second timer that increases as players progress through the levels.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>One of the technical highlights of MemoryRace is the automated game generation. I used code to ensure the game creates new and unique challenges every time you play, making it an endless source of fun. I also designed all the game's visuals myself, using a combination of AI and Photoshop to create a captivating look and feel.
